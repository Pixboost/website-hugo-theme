It's 2022, and we are back with some amazing news! 

We made two big changes to our pricing: 

* ðŸŽ‰ Upgraded the Free plan by making it 5 times bigger ðŸŽ‰
* ðŸ˜Ž Added a brand new one packed with awesome features ðŸ˜Ž

In this blog we'll show and tell you about both.

## What you pay for

The main pricing component of each plan is bandwidth. Let's see what it is for a start:

You pay for the optimised image traffic that delivered to your users when using Pixboost.

Typically, you'll see CDN cost reduction compare to when serving unoptimised images.

And here is what's good about this bandwidth:

* Delivers responsive images using the next generation formats (AVIF/WebP)
* 100+ locations Worldwide with anycast IP
* HTTP/3 protocol support

## Bigger Free plan

Our Free plan now includes 10Gb (was 2 Gb) of CDN bandwidth which makes Pixboost a viable option to run a small to medium website with Image CDN for free! 

Now, let's see how much is 10Gb. We made some research and on average when using Pixboost a landing or homepage contains 640Kb of images. Let's see how many page views will fit in 10Gb

{{< full-width-image image="10gb.png" alt="how many page views in 10Gb" >}}

It's about 15 thousand of pages views, and this number is conservative given homepages are heavy on images and 640 Kb includes all images, however you could (should) lazy load the ones below the fold.

## New "All Included" plan

Running the service, we realised that our top plan is too small and 200Gb (previous biggest plan) is reached by many of our customers, so we had our internal standard tier-1 "Enterprise" offering for the customers that use less than 1Tb of traffic. To make things simpler we added another plan since we removed one by extending our free offering.

So, here it is our brand new "All Included" plan with all the bells and whistles. 

* 1000Gb of CDN bandwidth
* Unlimited number of transformations
* 5 custom domain names
* SLA
* 1000 [workflow API calls](https://help.pixboost.com/workflows)

Using the example from the above let's sew how many page views it will fit if the page contains 640 Kb of images.

## Changes to Terms of Service

The prices and plans are part of the [Terms of Service document](https://pixboost.com/terms-of-service/), so we did our first update in the document since 2017! Of course, we spotted some grammar mistakes and areas to improve readability. 

We tried to make the history of changes as transparent as possible. A new version contains the link to the previous version and summary of changes made, so it's easier for our users to see the difference.

## Conclusion

The goal of Pixboost to make the Internet inclusive and accessible place, and that's not only from prospective of end users who loads the images, but web developers and companies, so they can offer the best possible User Experience from the start.
