It's 2022 finally, and we are back with some amazing news! We made changes to our pricing: upgraded Free plan, and added a brand new one all packed with awesome features. 

## Bigger Free plan

Our new Free plan now includes 10Gb of outbound traffic which makes Pixboost a viable option to run small to medium website for free! Firstly, let's see what outbound traffic means:

When you use Pixboost you pay for the optimised image traffic that delivered to your client. In most of the cases it allows to reduce CDN costs when serving unoptimised images.

Now, let's see how much is 10Gb. We made some research and usually when using Pixboost a typical landing page contains 630Kb of images. Let's see how many page views will fit in 10Gb

## New "All Included" plan

Running the service we realised that our top plan is too small and 200Gb (previous biggest plan) is reached easily, so we had our standard tier-1 "Enterprise" offering for the customers that use less than 1Tb of traffic. We decided that it would be easier if we just add another plan since we removed one by extending our free offering.

So, here it is our "All Included" plan that has all the bells and whistles. Using the example from the above let's sew how many page views it will fit if the page contains 630 Kb of images.

## Other changes to pricing and plans

We updated limitations on the billing plans:

* Custom Domain Name is now available from "Advanced" plan and you can have up to 5 on the "All Included" plan

## Changes to Terms of Service

The prices and plans are part of the [Terms of Service document](https://pixboost.com/terms-of-service/), so we did our first update there. We've also spotted some mistakes and improved readability. A new version contains the link to the previous version and list of changes made, so it's easier for our users to see the difference.
